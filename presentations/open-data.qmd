## What is Open Research Data?
| <span style="color:green">What it IS</span> | <span style="color:red">What it ISN'T</span> |
|------------|----------------|
| <span style="color:green">**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**eusable</span> | <span style="color:red">Private, hidden, or siloed (e.g., stored only on EPG-Share)</span> |

## What is Open Research Data?
| <span style="color:green">What it IS</span> | <span style="color:red">What it ISN'T</span> |
|------------|----------------|
| <span style="color:green">Has a **permanent identifier** (e.g., DOI)</span> | <span style="color:red">Lost or unreferenced datasets (e.g., only on OneDrive)</span> |

## What is Open Research Data?
| <span style="color:green">What it IS</span> | <span style="color:red">What it ISN'T</span> |
|------------|----------------|
| <span style="color:green">Accessible to **anyone** and **everyone**</span> | <span style="color:red">Restricted to select users only (e.g., access-controlled dashboards)</span> |

|------------|----------------|
| <span style="color:green">Promotes a **spirit of sharing**</span> | <span style="color:red">Does **not** mean giving away your work or letting others claim credit</span> |

## Why Should We Adopt Open Research Data?

::: {.fragment}
- Enhances research transparency, reproducibility and trust.
  <small>OpenSciency, 2025</small>
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Boosts citation rates and career visibility for early researchers.
  <small>F1000, 2023</small>
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Reduces duplication of efforts.
  <small>F1000, 2023</small>
:::

::: {.notes}
- Master thesis example of 15 techno-economic models.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Build upon open data without constraints.
  <small>OpenSciency, 2025</small>
:::

::: {.notes}
- More citations, more work done with open research than with closed
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Increasingly a mandatory requirement from funding orgs.

## Current ORD practices at EPG

::: {.fragment}
- Tools and Repositories? 
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Documenting Changes and Version Control?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Metadata, access, and sharing?
:::

::: {.notes}
- What tools do we use today to ensure our data remains open?
- How do we version control our datasets and document changes we make?
- Are data self-explanatory? Who can access it and how?
:::

## How can we develop ORD practices?


::: {.fragment}
- How do we integrate ORD into existing workflows?
::: 

::: {.fragment}
- How do we create best practices and policies? 
::: 

::: {.fragment}
- How do we train ourselves RAs, and thesis students to follow these practices? 
::: 

## Proposal

::: {.fragment}
- Create initial best practices document and discuss at the next team meeting.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- We use this document and iterate to improve while beginning to make ORD a habit.
:::

::: {.notes}
- It goes beyond human readable tables and Excel/CSVs and PDFs with supplementary data. 
- Over time, this data could unlock future research for EPG and others
